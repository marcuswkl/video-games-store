                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe are 🥓🥚Baycon & E.ggs, inspired by the favourite American breakfast. 
                We bring you the most juicy and eggcelent games (much like our bacon and eggs).
                As for why our logo only consists of a strip of bacon? You'll have to ask the admin where the eggs went.😏<br><br>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFounded 2020, DC (During Corona🦠) by Miss Mohana when giving her students an assignment to make an e-commerce website.😂
                You can watch the video behind the establishment of the company <a class="about-us-link" href="https://youtu.be/TAPRWRyXDfE?t=4" target="_blank">here</a>!

            <p class="about-us-description">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe CEO of 🥓🥚Baycon & E.ggs is none other than Mr Eddy, who is appointed solely due to his ability to
                get people eggcited about our games. However, due to the lack of pictures, we will have to settle with the only one we have at our disposal
                for this introduction. Sorry not sorry. 😛<br><br>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you find him hot 🥵, you only need to shoot us an email at <a class="about-us-link" href="contact.php">Contact Us</a>
                to get exclusive access into his private DMs. Also he is totally our admin🍆💦.
